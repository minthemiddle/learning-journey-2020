# learning-journey-2020
My public coding learning journey 2020 with goals, progress and notes.

- I code as a __part-time freelancer__
- I have __very limited time__ for learning new things (~4hrs/week)
- I hence need to __focus on one technology: Laravel__
- That's why I decided to have just __3 goals with 3 courses__
- I will only work on __one resource at a time__
- I am an __active text-based learner__
- When I watch videos, I need to __take notes and follow along with an actual Laravel project__
- Hence, working through a video requires me __4x the playing time of the videos__
- I share the __progress (in %)__  in this document 
- I take __local Markdown notes__ (in Quiver)
- I will share a __summary of my notes__ in this document
- I paid for all 3 resources, so I want some good ROI on them!
- If I happen to finish all 3 courses early I will create __1 new stretch goal at a time__
